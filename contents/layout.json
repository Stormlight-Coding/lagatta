    "body": "Lagoon’s ambition was to equip the SEVENTY 7 with the DNA of a superyacht in a design that visually shows the quest for excellence. This idea was prime in designing all the areas of the boat so that each line is integrated into the whole without dissonance. From the flybridge to the skirts and from the bow towards the stern; spaces are plentiful and all are connected simultaneously."

  "cabins": {
    "title": "CABINS",
    "body": "LA GATTA features four elegantly designed guest cabins. Each of these are fitted with an island bed, ample storage, and private bathroom. The spacious master suite features a hydraulic platform which opens to create a private “beach” giving direct sea access and a special spot to sunbathe. The crew quarters and galley are configured as to facilitate the staff’s work on board. Two bunks in the forepeak allow for two additional guests. The LYNX bed can be configured as a queen or two twins."
