This idea was prime in designing all the areas of the boat so that each line is integrated into the whole without dissonance. From the flybridge to the skirts and from the bow towards the stern; spaces are plentiful and all are connected simultaneously."

The crew quarters and galley are configured as to facilitate the staff’s work on board. Two bunks in the forepeak are a fun spot for two kids. The LYNX bed can be configured as a queen or two twins."
