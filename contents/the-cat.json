Lagoon brought together an illustrious team for the design of its flagship: VPLP, Patrick Le Quément and Nauta Design. All have strived to produce a catamaran where harmony reigns between the interior and exterior living spaces, where compromise does not exist, where innovation enhances comfort and life at sea.",

Clever use of space means your eight passengers can stretch out with space for their belongings. Handy for moving a lot of people, but even better for loading it up with fine food for a spot of alfresco dining on a secluded beach. After lunch, drop anchor, unfurl the optional bimini and lower the bathing ladder. Or for those adrenaline seekers, blast away the afternoon waterskiing.",
